Connect to CMU Device:
    Static IP address : 172.26.198.249

    Jetson Name : Nvidia

    A general SSH command : ssh nvidia@172.26.198.249

    Make sure the Jetson is connected to "CMU Device" (It is set as default)

    Should the jetson loose wi-fi connection in the elevator or outside, use joystick to control the Husky

    The other alternative is to use laptop and directly interface the Husky via the RS-232
